The document primarily focuses on the coordination of incident response activities, communication, and information sharing between CISA and FCEB agencies, along with the responsibilities of various groups such as the Cyber Unified Coordination Group (C-UCG). However, it emphasizes the importance of communication and situational awareness between agency leadership and CISA, which may imply coordination at various organizational levels, including the SOC and executive leadership.\n"
