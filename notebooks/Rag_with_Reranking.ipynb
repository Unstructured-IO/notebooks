        "# RAG for Patent Question Answering with Reranker\n",
        "\n",
        "Most retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines follow a common recipe: take a user’s question, retrieve relevant documents, and feed them to a language model to generate a response. This works reasonably well — until it doesn't.\n",
        "\n",
        "When dealing with complex domains like patents, the limitations of naive retrieval become glaring:\n",
        "- The language is dense and technical.\n",
        "- Similarity-based retrievers often surface verbose but irrelevant sections.\n",
        "- Critical information may be buried across long documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we’ll build a more **robust and domain-aware RAG system** specifically designed to answer technical and legal questions over patents. To improve retrieval quality, we’ll incorporate a **reranker** — a model that sits between retrieval and generation, reshuffling candidate passages to surface the most answer-relevant chunks.\n",
        "\n",
        "This system will:\n",
        "- Load and structure unstructured patent filings using the [Unstructured Platform](https://unstructured.io/).\n",
        "- Ingest data into a [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/product/) vector database for fast semantic retrieval.\n",
        "- Re-rank retrieved candidates using **Cohere’s `rerank-english-v3.0`**.\n",
        "- Answer user questions using **GPT-4o** grounded in the reranked context.\n",
        "\n",
        "We’ll go step by step — starting with document ingestion and ending with an end-to-end QA pipeline that performs well even on nuanced queries.\n",

        "- **Chunker**  \n",
        "  After partitioning, the extracted elements are grouped into manageable \"chunks.\"  \n",
