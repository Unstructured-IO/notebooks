    "# Building an AI Weekly Newsletter Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI industry moves fast. Every week brings new research papers, blog posts, product announcements, and technical breakthroughs. Keeping up with developments from ArXiv, OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, DeepLearning.AI, and other sources can be overwhelming. How do you stay informed without spending hours reading through dozens of publications?\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "AI news comes in many formats—research papers (PDFs), blog posts (HTML), newsletters, and articles. Manually tracking and summarizing content from multiple sources is time-consuming and often incomplete. What busy professionals need is an automated system that collects relevant AI content and generates a concise weekly summary of what matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for collecting, processing, and summarizing AI industry content into a weekly newsletter. We use:\n",
    "- **Automated scraping** to collect recent AI papers and blog posts\n",
    "- **Unstructured's hi_res processing** to extract clean text from PDFs and HTML\n",
    "- **AI-powered summarization** to create concise, actionable summaries\n",
    "- **Customizable prompts** so you can tailor the newsletter to your audience\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "A complete weekly AI newsletter system that scrapes the last 7 days of content from ArXiv and leading AI blogs, processes the documents through Unstructured's API, and generates both detailed summaries and an executive brief.\n",

For detailed S3 setup instructions, see the [Unstructured S3 source connector documentation](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/api-services/source-connectors/s3).\n",

    "\n",
    "This cell uses Firecrawl to scrape recent blog posts from leading AI companies, extracting clean HTML content. The default configuration collects posts from the **last 7 days** across multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Blog Sources (Pre-configured):**\n",
    "- **Hugging Face** (`https://huggingface.co/blog`) - Model releases, tutorials, community posts\n",
    "- **OpenAI** (`https://openai.com/news/`) - Product announcements and research updates\n",
    "- **DeepLearning.AI** (`https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/`) - Weekly Batch newsletter issues\n",
    "- **Anthropic** (`https://www.anthropic.com/research`) - Claude updates and research papers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Configuration (Customize This):**\n",
    "- `DAYS_BACK`: How many days of recent posts to retrieve (default: 7 days)\n",
    "- Modify `BLOG_SOURCES` dictionary to add/remove sources\n",
    "\n",
    "**What It Does:**\n",
    "1. Scrapes blog directory pages using Firecrawl with link extraction\n",
    "2. Filters blog post URLs using source-specific rules (excludes images, navigation pages, etc.)\n",
    "3. Scrapes individual post content with 1-second delay between requests\n",
    "4. Uploads clean HTML to S3 under `blog-posts/{source}/` with metadata\n",
    "5. Provides summary statistics by source\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Firecrawl?** Firecrawl handles JavaScript-rendered content, provides clean HTML output, and respects website structures, making it ideal for scraping modern AI company blogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extensibility**: Add more sources by extending the `BLOG_SOURCES` dictionary with additional blog URLs and configuring appropriate filtering rules."
