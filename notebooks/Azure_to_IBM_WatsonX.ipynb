Think of each node as a small, focused operation in a larger data prep pipeline. These steps can include things like turning a PDF into structured JSON, generating image captions, or creating embeddings for search.\n",

        "\n",
        "Every workflow starts with a `PARTITION` node. This is the required first step and forms the foundation for everything else. Its job is to take in raw documents—PDFs, markdown files, emails, you name it—and convert them into a standardized JSON format that the rest of the pipeline can understand.\n",

        "- **Auto** : A smart mode that chooses the best strategy based on the page. It balances performance and cost by dynamically selecting between VLM, High Res, or Fast.\n",
        "- **VLM**: Uses vision-language models to extract content from hard-to-read documents—like scans with handwriting or complex layouts.\n",
        "- **High Res**: A solid choice for scanned image-based documents that need strong OCR plus layout understanding.\n",
        "- **Fast**: Ideal for well-structured text files like markdown or Word docs. Lightweight and efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you’re curious about the structure of the output, you can explore the JSON schema [here](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/document-elements).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Breaking It Down with Chunking\n",
        "\n",
        "The next node type you’ll usually add is the `CHUNK` node. This node helps divide the document into smaller, coherent pieces of text. Why do this? Because most embedding models (and downstream tools like vector databases) work best with bite-sized chunks that fit within token limits.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can read more about chunking strategies [here](https://docs.unstructured.io/ui/chunking).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Generating Embeddings\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, there’s the `EMBED` node. This is where your clean, chunked content gets converted into numerical vector representations—aka *embeddings*. These vectors can then power similarity search, clustering, or RAG pipelines.\n",
